## Description

A library app that can keep track of books as well as adding them in the current collection and rent them to people.  
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## How to run

You do not need any database as the project uses [Recoil.js](https://recoiljs.org/) to hold it's state. 
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
